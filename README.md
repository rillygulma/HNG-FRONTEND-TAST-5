## Dev Links

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The project is a link aggregator for developers! It utilizes Node, Typescript and Postgres on the backend, Tailwind and Radix Primitives on the frontend, AWS for file storage.

## Details

### User Authentication w/ Credentials & Github

Users can sign up and login with their email and password. They can also sign up and login with their Github account. The Github OAuth flow is handled by the server, and the user is redirected back to the client with a JWT token. The client then stores the token in a cookie and uses it for subsequent requests.

If a user already has an account, and then logs in with Github, the two accounts will be linked to the user via logic in the signIn callback (Next-Auth).

### Create/Edit/Delete Links

Users can create, edit and delete links. The links are stored in a Postgres database. The links are validated server-side to ensure they are valid URLs.

### Drag and Drop Links (Reorder)

Users can drag and drop links to reorder them. The order is stored in the database and persisted in the client for a seamless user experience.

### Preview Aggregated Links

Users can preview their aggregated links. The preview rendered server-side in a component and reused in multiple places in the app, including the external-facing 'Dev Link' (your custom link containing all aggregated links).

### Generate Dev Link

The 'Dev Link' is generated when a user registers based on their username. The link is a dynamic, SSR'ed route that fetches the user's links and displays them for the external viewer.

### Add/Edit Profile Details

Profile details can be added/edited by the user. The form is submitted and details are updated in the database. Image uploads are handled separately.

### Upload Profile Picture via Drag and Drop

Users can upload a profile picture via drag and drop. The image is uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket and the URL is stored in the database. The dropzone is tied to a callback that triggers when the image file is uploaded.

### Responsive Design

The app is responsive and works on mobile, tablet and desktop.
